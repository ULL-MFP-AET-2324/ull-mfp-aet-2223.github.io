## Announcing GitHub Global Campus and Codespaces for Teachers

GitHub  announced in May 9th 2022 this message:

<https://github.com/github-community/Global-Campus-Teachers/discussions/79>

which is inside of the new page for everything that has to do with educational resources:

<https://education.github.com/>

One of the things they comment on is a certain number of hours of Codespaces integrated with Classroom:

* Your Global Campus teacher status with GitHub gives you a free monthly allowance of Codespaces hours to use in your classroom. 
* The free allowance is estimated to be enough for a class of 50 with 5 assignments per month, on a 2 core machine with 1 codespace stored per student, which is more than enough to get your students coding like pros in an environment that brings out the best in their skills and allows you to teach seamlessly. 
* For teachers whose workflows extend beyond the free allowance, more details on Codespaces billing can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-codespaces#codespaces-pricing).
