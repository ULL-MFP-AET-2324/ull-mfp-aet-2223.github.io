# {{ page.title }}

It is possible to host a website within Moodle following these instructions:

## Step 1: Links within your webpages must be relative to each other

Ensure that all links within your webpages are relative to each other, meaning if you have an `index.html` page and a `book.html` page in the same directory, as a link to the `book.html` page from the `index page`, you have `/book.html`.  

The links will not work properly otherwise. 

*  Read the section [Understanding site.url and site.baseurl](jekyll-baseurl.html) to learn how to do this with Jekyll

## Step 2: Zip the root directory of the site  

### On Codespaces

On your codespaces and also in a mac you have installed the `zip` program: `zip -r _site.zip _site`

```
$ zip --help
Copyright (c) 1990-2008 Info-ZIP - Type 'zip "-L"' for software license.
Zip 3.0 (July 5th 2008). Usage:
zip [-options] [-b path] [-t mmddyyyy] [-n suffixes] [zipfile list] [-xi list]
The default action is to add or replace zipfile entries from list, which
can include the special name - to compress standard input.
If zipfile and list are omitted, zip compresses stdin to stdout.
-f   freshen: only changed files  -u   update: only changed or new files
-d   delete entries in zipfile    -m   move into zipfile (delete OS files)
-r   recurse into directories     -j   junk (don't record) directory names
-0   store only                   -l   convert LF to CR LF (-ll CR LF to LF)
-1   compress faster              -9   compress better
-q   quiet operation              -v   verbose operation/print version info
-c   add one-line comments        -z   add zipfile comment
-@   read names from stdin        -o   make zipfile as old as latest entry
-x   exclude the following names  -i   include only the following names
-F   fix zipfile (-FF try harder) -D   do not add directory entries
-A   adjust self-extracting exe   -J   junk zipfile prefix (unzipsfx)
-T   test zipfile integrity       -X   eXclude eXtra file attributes
-y   store symbolic links as the link instead of the referenced file
-e   encrypt                      -n   don't compress these suffixes
-h2  show more help
```

### Alternative: Use GitHub Action Generated Artifact

Got to the GH action for building the site and donwload the generated artifact zip file to your local machine

## Step 3: Upload the zip file to Moodle

1.  Go to the Moodle course and click the <button>Turn Editing on</button> button
2.  Choose the Topics Block where you want to add the assignment and click **Add an activity or resource**.
3.  Select the **File** activity in the Activity Chooser.
4.  Add the zip file as the file for this resource.![Zip file added](https://forge.lafayette.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/451/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-05-at-3.19.29-PM.png)
5.  Select the zip file in the file picker, and a popup window will appear.  
    - Select **unzip**, a folder will appear in the file picker.

6.  Navigate into the folder and select your “index” page.  
    - Once selected, choose the “Set main file” option from the popup window.

7.  Under the “Appearance” resource option there are several Display options that allow you to set the webpage to be embedded in the site, open as a pop-up, etc.  
    ![Set the Display setting to "Embed"](https://forge.lafayette.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/451/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2020-05-28-at-1.15.50-PM.png)

**Note:** Individual files can be updated after this process is done so you will not need to re-upload the entire zip file whenever a change is necessary.
